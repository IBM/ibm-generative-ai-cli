# IBM Generative AI CLI (Tech Preview)

This is not the [watsonx.ai](https://www.ibm.com/products/watsonx-ai) CLI. This is the CLI for the Tech Preview program for IBM Foundation Models Studio.
You can start a trial version or request a demo via https://www.ibm.com/products/watsonx-ai.

This project provides convenient access to the Generative AI API from the command line. For a full description of the API, please visit the [Generative AI API Documentation](https://bam.res.ibm.com/docs/api-reference).

_Are you looking for an SDK?<br>
If so, check out the [NodeJS SDK](https://github.com/IBM/ibm-generative-ai-node-sdk) and [Python SDK](https://github.com/IBM/ibm-generative-ai)._

## Installation

The CLI is distributed as an [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ibm-generative-ai/cli) package. [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org) runtime with sufficient version is required.

### Script

Preferred way of installing the CLI is the install script. If NodeJS is not detected, it is installed via [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm).

```bash
source <(curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IBM/ibm-generative-ai-cli/main/install.sh)
```

```bash
source <(wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IBM/ibm-generative-ai-cli/main/install.sh)
```

### NPM

The CLI can also be installed directly using npm:

```bash
npm install -g @ibm-generative-ai/cli
```

## Configuration

Create default configuration:

```bash
genai config
```

One can also create profile-specific configuration:

```bash
genai --profile joe config
```

All the commands executed with `--profile joe` argument will use that configuration (and default as a fallback).

### Autocompletion

The full commands have many segments due to alignment with the SDK and REST API. The CLI works best with autocompletion. Run the following to activate autocompletion, replace `.zshrc` with the configuration file of your shell:

```bash
genai completion >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc
```

### Output format

You can choose default output format during `genai config` or set it via `--output-format` flag. Choices are `yaml` and `json`. Former is ideal for direct viewing, latter for piping into [jq](https://jqlang.github.io/jq/).

## Commands

```bash
$ genai --help
genai <command>

Commands:
  genai config      Manage CLI configuration
  genai text        Text generation, tokenization and chat services
  genai model       Available models
  genai file        Upload, download and manage files
  genai request     Request history (for the past 30 days)
  genai tune        Train and manage tuned models
  genai completion  Generate completion script
```
